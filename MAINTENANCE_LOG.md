### ðŸŸ¡ Low Priority - SSE Keepalive Warning Fix

**Date Logged:** October 28, 2025  
**Status:** Optional - Cosmetic Improvement  
**Severity:** Low - Does not affect functionality

**Issue:**
SSE event streaming logs harmless warnings when Home Assistant sends keepalive pings:
```
WARNING - Failed to parse event JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
```

**Root Cause:**
Home Assistant sends empty "data:" lines to maintain SSE connections. Current code tries to parse these as JSON.

**Fix Available:**
Add empty-string check before JSON parsing (line 4085-4087 in server.py):
```python
event_json = line.split(":", 1)[1].strip()

# Skip empty data lines (keepalive pings)
if not event_json:
    continue
```

**Deployment:**
```bash
# When ready, copy and deploy:
scp server.py root@192.168.1.203:/config/server_104_sse_keepalive_fix.py
ssh root@192.168.1.203 "docker cp /config/server_104_sse_keepalive_fix.py 37acc1b94de1:/app/server.py && docker restart 37acc1b94de1"
```

**Impact If Not Fixed:**
- SSE streaming continues to work perfectly
- Logs contain harmless warnings
- No functional issues

**Impact When Fixed:**
- Cleaner logs
- More professional appearance
- Better distinguishes real errors from normal keepalive behavior

**Reference:** See `SSE_KEEPALIVE_FIX.md` for full details
